        <p>"it all started one dreary day in january as i entered the cave, the bears looked up. knowing i wasn't an immediate threat, they fell back into their slumber. deep down, though, they knew why i was there. they knew what they took from me. 17 years later i had finally come back to retrieve my iphone charger. i draw pixel art with paper and ink and stuff, as well as digitally. i hope you like them." <br> <span>- xoxo j$</span></p>

      <article class="code"><h2>Code</h2>
        <p>I have spent a few years talking about and teaching programming to people as young as 8 and as old as 80. The one interest I've been able to map to all ages is art. Teaching people to code using art as a motivation has been a fun learning and teaching experience but, to be quite honest, I could learn a lot more from both subjects.</p>
