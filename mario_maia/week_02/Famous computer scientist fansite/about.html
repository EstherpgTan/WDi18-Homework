      <h1> Computer programmer. Ruby designer. Mormon.</h1>
        <h2 class="lifeAtGlance">My life at glance </h2>
          <p class="bio">I was born and raised in coastal city of Yonago, Japan. I became interested in programming when I was a middle school student, and since studying Computer Science at Tsukuba University I have been working as a programmer. Since 1993 I have been designing and developing the open source Ruby programming language. Ruby has now become a very popular programming language around the world, and it is widely used in many fields including the Web. Since 1997 I have been living in Matsue City in Shimane Prefecture, which isn’t too far from where I grew up. It is also a beautiful city. I have a wife and 4 children. My two eldest daughters are currently attending school in Tokyo, and the youngest two—a son and a daughter—live at home with us.</p>
