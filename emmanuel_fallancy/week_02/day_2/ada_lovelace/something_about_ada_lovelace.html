            <li>Ada met Charles Babbage through their mutual friend, Mary Somerville, which then Babbage invited her to see the prototype of Difference Engine.</li>
            <li>Charles Babbage recognised her as <em>The Enchantress of Number</em></li>
            <li>Charles Dickens (who is a famous writer back then) used to read to her on her deathbed.</li>
            <li>At the age of 12, Ada conceptualised a flying machine; illustrated plans on constructing a winged flying apparatus before moving on to think about powered flight.</li>
            <li>Ada Lovelace was a visionary who predicted that computers could do more than just crunching numbers.</li>
            <li>A computer programming is named after her, in honour of her. <em>Ada</em> programming language (high-order programming language) was developed by U.S. Department of Defence (1979).</li>
