          <ul>
            <li>Ada Lovelace had a close working relationship with Charles Babbage, who is also her mentor, on the analytical engine.</li>
            <li>She had helped also translated the work of Italian engineer, Luigi Menabrea, which she also supplemented an elaborated set of notes.</li>
            <li>The notes, many would consider to be the first computer program, contained an algorithm designed to be carried out by a machine.</li>
            <li>Ada's Notes to the translation of Menabrea's memoirs terminated with a step-by-step description of how <em>'the engine could compute the Numbers of Bernoulli, this being (in the form in which we shall deduce it) a rather complicated example of its powers.</em></li>
