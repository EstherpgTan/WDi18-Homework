  <p>Noted as a founder of information theory, Claude Shannon combined mathematical theories with engineering principles to set the stage for the development of the digital computer. The term ‘bit,’ today used to describe individual units of information processed by a computer, was coined from Shannon’s research in the 1940s.

He published A Mathematical Theory of Communication in in the Bell System Technical Journal (1948). His work founded the subject of information theory and he proposed a linear schematic model of a communications system. He gave a method of analysing a sequence of error terms in a signal to find their inherent variety, matching them to the designed variety of the control system.

In 1952 he devised an experiment illustrating the capabilities of telephone relays.</p>
