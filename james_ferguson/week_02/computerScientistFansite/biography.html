<!-- info about Grace -->
<p>Grace Hopper was born Grace Brewster Murray on December 9th, 1906 in New York City. Grace was remarkable woman who first earned a BA in mathmatics and physics, then went on to obtain an MA and a PHD at Yale. In 1943, she joined the United States Naval Reserve to assit her country in it's wartime challenges. After initial training at Midshipman's School, after which she was commissioned a Lieutenant, Hopper was assigned to the Bureau of Ordnance Computation Project at the Cruft Laboratories at Harvard University.  </p>

<p>Upon her arrival at Cruft Laboratory she met the Mark I computer, which she could hardly wait to disassemble and figure out! Grace was given programming tasks and by the end of the war, Hopper was working on the Harvard Mark II computer and later went on work on the mark III.</p>

<p>In 1949 Hopper joined the Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation as a Senior Mathematician and there she worked with John Eckert and John Mauchly on the UNIVAC computer. She designed an improved compiler while working for the company and was part of the team which developed Flow-Matic, the first English-language compiler. In 1951 a maintenance engineer discovered a moth stuck in one of the relais. She pasted the "computer bug" as it is known from now on, into the UNIVAC I logbook. Earning eternal fame!</p>

<h2> The Compiler </h2>

<h3> The name "compiler" is primarily used for programs that translate source code from a high-level programming language to a lower level language (e.g., assembly language or machine code)</h3>

<p>In 1952 Grace had an operational compiler. "Nobody believed that," she said. "I had a running compiler and nobody would touch it. They told me computers could only do arithmetic."[21]

In 1954 Hopper was named the company's first director of automatic programming, and her department released some of the first compiler-based programming languages, including MATH-MATIC and FLOW-MATIC.</p>

<h4> COBOL </h4>

<p>In the 1970s, Hopper advocated for the Defense Department to replace large, centralized systems with networks of small, distributed computers. Any user on any computer node could access common databases located on the network.[20]:119 She developed the implementation of standards for testing computer systems and components, most significantly for early programming languages such as FORTRAN and COBOL. The Navy tests for conformance to these standards led to significant convergence among the programming language dialects of the major computer vendors. In the 1980s, these tests (and their official administration) were assumed by the National Bureau of Standards (NBS), known today as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).</p>
