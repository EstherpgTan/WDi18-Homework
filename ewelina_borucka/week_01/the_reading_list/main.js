// Keep track of which books you read and which books you want to read!
//
// 1. Create an array of objects,
// where each object describes a book and has properties for
// the title (a string), author (a string),
// and alreadyRead (a boolean indicating if you read it yet).

// 2. Iterate through the array of books. For each book,
// log the book title and book author
// like so: "The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien".

// 3. Now use an if/else statement to change the output
// depending on whether you read it yet or not.
// If you read it, log a string like
// 'You already read "The Hobbit" by J.R.R. Tolkien',
// and if not, log a string like
// 'You still need to read "The Lord of the Rings" by J.R.R. Tolkien.'
