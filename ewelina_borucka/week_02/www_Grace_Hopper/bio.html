    <p class="text"><span class="gradient1">Born in New York City in 1906, Grace Hopper
      joined the U.S. Navy during World War II and was assigned to program the Mark I computer.
      She continued to work in computing after the war, leading the team that created the first
      computer language compiler, which led to the popular COBOL language.</span><span class="gradient2">
      She resumed active naval service at the age of 60, becoming a rear admiral before retiring
      in 1986. Hopper died in Virginia in 1992.</span>

      <span class="gradient3">Early Life
      Born Grace Brewster Murray in New York City on December 9, 1906, Grace
      Hopper studied math and physics at Vassar College. After graduating from
      Vassar in 1928, she proceeded to Yale University, where, in 1930, she received
      a master's degree in mathematics. That same year, she married Vincent Foster Hopper,
      becoming Grace Hopper (a name that she kept even after the couple's 1945 divorce).
      Starting in 1931, Hopper began teaching at Vassar while also continuing to study at Yale,
      where she earned a Ph.D. in mathematics in 1934â€”becoming one of the first few woman to
      earn such a degree. </span><span class="gradient4">World War II Hopper, who became an
      associate professor at Vassar, continued to teach until World War II compelled her to join
      the U.S. Naval Reserve in December 1943.</span><a class="more" href="#">Read more ..</a>
